      <h3>Types of web developers</h3>
      <p>Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end developers, front-end developers, and full-stack developers. Some web developers also work as webmasters. Let’s take a closer look at each of these roles.
</p>   
       <div class="sub-content">
         <ul>
           <li><span class="bold">Back-end web developers</span> create the website’s structure, write code, and verify the code works. Their responsibilities also may include managing access points for others who need to manage a website’s content.</li>
           <li><span class="bold">Front-end web developers</span> work on the visual part of the website—the pages visitors see and interact with (also known as the user interface). They design the physical layout of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site. </li>
           <li><span class="bold">Full-stack developers</span> do the work of both a back-end and front-end developer. These developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may work for organizations that don’t have the budget for a large website team. </li>
           <li><span class="bold">Webmasters</span> are essentially website managers. Their primary responsibility is to keep the website updated, ensuring that the links and applications on each page work properly.</li>

         <div class="lines"></div>
        <p>A formal education isn’t always necessary to become an entry-level web developer. Some web developers have an associate or bachelor’s degree in website design or computer science, but others teach themselves how to code and design websites. While earning a degree can make you a more competitive candidate, a strong portfolio can go a long way toward validating your skills to potential employers.</p>
        <p>If you’re interested in becoming a web developer, here are some steps you can take.</p>
        <h3>1. Build web developer skills</h3>
        <p>Employers and clients usually expect web developers to have certain skills that demonstrate their ability to deliver on website requirements. If you’re interested in a career as a web developer, these are some skills you can focus on to build a foundation for success.</p>
        <p class="bold sub-titles">Technical skills</p>
        <div class="sub-content">
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Coding:</span> Common programming languages include HTML, PHP, cascading style sheets, and JavaScript for front-end design. Consider learning Python, Java, or Ruby if you want to do back-end development.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Responsive design:</span> People use a variety of devices to view websites. Developers should be able to create sites that look as good on smartphones and tablets as they do on computer screens.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Technical SEO:</span> Many factors of website design can affect the site’s search engine ranking. Understanding how search engines rank sites is useful in a developer’s work.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Version control:</span> This lets you track and control changes to the source code without starting over from the beginning each time you run into a problem.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Visual design:</span> Understanding basic design principles, such as how to use white space, choose fonts, and incorporate images could boost your marketability.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
         <p class="bold sub-titles">Workplace skills</p>
        <div class="sub-content">
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Communication:</span> Web developers spend time discussing design ideas with their clients and team members through each step of the project.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Customer service:</span> A web developer creates websites for the client to use and should remain client-focused to achieve the best results.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Detail-oriented:</span> Little details, like a small change in code, can make a big difference in how a website performs.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Organization:</span> Keeping track of deadlines, project tasks, workflow, and budgets is helpful if you want to complete a website design on time.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Problem-solving:</span> Web developers often run into issues when designing websites. They should have the patience and ability to identify problems in the design or coding and solve them in a methodical way.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>2. Consider a degree in computer science or web design</h3>
        <p>While you don’t always need a degree to get a job in web development, it can certainly help. If you’re already in school (or considering earning a degree), some majors might be a better fit for your career goals than others. If you’re more interested in back-end web development, consider a degree program in computer science. If you feel more drawn to front-end development, you might opt for a degree in web design or user experience (UX).</p>
        <h3>3. Take a course in web development.</h3>
        <p>You don’t necessarily need formal training to work as a web developer. It’s possible to acquire the skills you need on your own. For example, you can take a course to learn programming languages like HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, and then put what you learn into practice on your own website.</p>
        <h3>4. Built a portfolio of web development work.
</h3>
        <p>As a web developer, your portfolio is often one of the most important parts of your resume. This collection of projects shows potential employers what you’re capable of creating. Include the types of projects that represent the work you’d like to do. If you’re including code, be sure to annotate it to show your thought process.</p>
        <h3>5. Get certified.</h3>
        <p>Earning a certification can validate your skill set to potential employers. You’ll find a range of general and vendor-specific options, including Adobe Certified Expert (ACE), Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSD), Amazon Web Services (AWS) Certified Developer, or Zend Certified PHP Engineer.</p>
